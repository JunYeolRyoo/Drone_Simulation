### Overview:
This project introduced new features into a drone simulation using various design patterns. Throughout the semester, we implemented several design patterns into an existing codebase, including:
  1. **Factory Design Pattern**: For the creation of Entities in the simulation.
  2. **Decorator Pattern**: For modifying how drones move.
  3. **Strategy Pattern**: For route-finding algorithms.
  4. **Observer Pattern**: Implemented to establish a dynamic interaction between human and the UFO entities.
  5. **Singleton Pattern**: For managing charging stations and battery entities.
